      <description>&lt;audio controls preload=&#34;auto&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;source src=&#34;/audio/036china.mp3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/audio&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Xiao ting wears a short-sleeved white shirt tucked into a pair of blue jeans. He has wavy, coiffed hair and big brown eyes, and smiles gently with the air of a high-school heart-throb. From morning to evening he attends to Ms Zhong, his 32-year-old girlfriend.
